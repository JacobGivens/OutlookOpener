# Outlook Opener
Small application meant to open Outlook when accidentally closed, may expand in future.

## Installation
A release is available in the side panel, download the OutlookOpen.exe. I recommend dropping the file in your user startup folder. For easy access to startup folder, use the folder location bar or `Win`+`R` and type in `shell:startup` to open the user startup folder (no admin privileges, recommended), or `shell:common startup` (for everyone, need admin privileges).
